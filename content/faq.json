    "question": "What's your daily jetting output?",
    "answer": "Typical daily production ranges from 15,000 to 25,000 feet depending on conduit diameter, route complexity, and cable count. Our rigs are calibrated for both microduct and standard 1.25\" HDPE. We mandrel-proof and pressure-verify every segment before placement begins."

    "question": "What does a clean handoff look like?",
    "answer": "Every enclosure is organized with clean tray routing, labeled strands, and sealed closures. We leave the site ready for the next crew or the end client — no loose ends, no callbacks. Geo-tagged photos of every splice point are available on request."

    "question": "What fiber types and counts do you handle?",
    "answer": "We work with single-mode, multimode, and ribbon fiber across counts from 12 to 864. Our splicing crews are equipped for both mass fusion (ribbon) and individual single-fiber fusion. Cable types include loose-tube, central-tube, and all-dielectric self-supporting (ADSS)."

    "question": "How fast can you mobilize a crew?",
    "answer": "Standard mobilization is 5 to 10 business days from signed scope. For emergency restoration and network outages, we maintain a 24-hour rapid deployment capability with crews staged across multiple regions. Call the emergency line and we move."
