# Master Prompt — Fiber Guys Website Build

**Paste this into Claude Code in Plan Mode.**

---

## Context

I'm building an Awwwards-level marketing website for **Fiber Guys**, a fiber construction company that does:
1. Fiber placement in conduit using jetters
2. Fiber splicing

The CLAUDE.md in the repo root has the full project spec — design direction, tokens, page structure, gallery requirements, form requirements, motion system, and quality gates. **Read CLAUDE.md thoroughly before doing anything.**

## What I Need You To Do

### Phase 1: Research (use tools)

Before writing any code, research and internalize current best practices for:

1. **Next.js 15 App Router architecture** — file conventions, `template.tsx` vs `layout.tsx` for page transitions, `generateMetadata`, Server Components vs Client Components boundaries, Route Handlers for form APIs
2. **Framer Motion in App Router** — the `template.tsx` approach for page transitions (since AnimatePresence + App Router is tricky), `whileInView` for scroll reveals, `layoutId` for shared-element-like gallery transitions, and the `useReducedMotion` hook
3. **Modern masonry gallery patterns** — CSS columns vs CSS grid masonry vs JS-based approaches, performance with next/image, blur placeholders, lazy loading strategies
4. **Custom cursor implementation** — how to scope a custom cursor to a specific DOM section only (gallery), cursor trail effects, and graceful degradation on touch devices
5. **File upload in Next.js** — Route Handlers with multipart form data, staged upload patterns, and how to structure the API so storage (S3/R2) can be plugged in later
6. **Awwwards-winning site patterns** — look at what actually wins on Awwwards: cinematic pacing, generous whitespace, bold type, signature interactions (magnetic buttons, signal-line motifs, custom cursors), and restrained motion

Use this research to make informed architectural decisions — don't just default to the most common approach.

### Phase 2: Plan

Produce a detailed implementation plan that includes:

1. **Project scaffold** — complete file tree matching the structure in CLAUDE.md
2. **Design tokens** — Tailwind config with all color, typography, spacing, and animation tokens
3. **Component architecture** — which components are Server vs Client, data flow, prop interfaces
4. **Animation system** — reusable hooks and utilities (useReducedMotion, useMagneticHover, useGalleryCursor, ScrollReveal wrapper, page transition approach)
5. **Gallery architecture** — masonry approach, filter state management, lightbox implementation (shared-element transitions using layoutId), cursor scoping strategy
6. **Form architecture** — component structure, validation approach, file upload UX, API route design with honeypot + rate limiting
7. **Performance strategy** — image optimization, lazy loading boundaries, bundle splitting, CLS prevention
8. **Implementation order** — what to build first, dependencies between components

### Phase 3: Implement

Build the entire site following the plan. Implementation priorities:

1. **Foundation first** — project setup, Tailwind config with tokens, fonts, global styles, grain overlay, root layout
2. **Layout shell** — Nav (sticky, responsive, with sliding indicator), Footer, page transition in template.tsx
3. **Home page** — all 6 sections (Hero with signal-line animation, Proof Strip, Services Preview, Process, Gallery Teaser, CTA Block)
4. **Gallery** — masonry grid, filter chips, lightbox with keyboard/swipe, custom cursor scoped to gallery
5. **Request form** — full form with file upload, validation, API route stub
6. **Remaining pages** — Services, About, Contact, Thank You
7. **Polish** — scroll reveals on all sections, magnetic buttons, metadata/OG on all pages, reduced motion support

### Phase 4: Verify

After implementation:
- Run `npm run build` and fix any errors
- Run TypeScript check and fix any type issues
- Walk through every quality gate in CLAUDE.md and confirm each one passes
- List any items that need real assets (photos, video, logo files) to be complete

## Key Technical Decisions (Pre-Made)

These are settled — don't second-guess them:

- **Next.js 15, App Router, TypeScript** — no Pages Router
- **Tailwind CSS** — all styling through Tailwind utilities and CSS variables
- **Framer Motion** — all animation (no GSAP, no CSS-only approach for complex interactions)
- **Content in JSON** — gallery.json and services.json, no CMS
- **Safety Orange (#FF5A1F) as sole accent** — no other accent colors
- **Dark theme only** — no light mode toggle needed
- **`template.tsx` for page transitions** — this is the correct App Router pattern since it remounts on navigation

## Design Quality Bar

This must look like it was built by a creative agency, not generated by AI. Specific things that separate "nice" from "Awwwards":

- **Typography hierarchy is dramatic** — H1s should be 64-84px on desktop, not timid
- **Whitespace is generous** — sections have 120-160px+ vertical padding, not cramped
- **The grid breathes** — content doesn't fill edge to edge, there's intentional negative space
- **Motion has personality** — the signal-line draw, magnetic buttons, and gallery cursor are signature moments that make the site memorable
- **Gallery is an experience** — the transition from thumbnail to lightbox should feel smooth and cinematic, not a basic modal pop
- **Color is restrained** — safety orange appears strategically (CTAs, hover states, the signal line) not splashed everywhere
- **Grain and auras are subtle** — if you notice them consciously, they're too strong

## Copy Guidelines

Write all copy as if you're a field-experienced foreman who also has impeccable taste. No marketing fluff. Examples:

- ✅ "High-output placement built for long runs and consistent results."
- ❌ "We leverage cutting-edge technology to deliver superior fiber solutions!"
- ✅ "Clean trays. Clear labels. Closeout-ready."
- ❌ "Our dedicated team ensures the highest quality splicing services."
